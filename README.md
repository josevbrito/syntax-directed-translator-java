## üìñ Project Description

This repository contains the step-by-step implementation of a simple interpreter for a custom procedural language. The project follows the principles of **Syntax-Directed Translation**, building the components of a compiler front-end and a simple back-end from scratch in Java.

The system is composed of three main parts:

1.  **Scanner (Lexer):** Reads the source code as a stream of characters and converts it into a sequence of tokens (e.g., `NUMBER`, `IDENT`, `LET`, `PLUS`).
2.  **Parser:** A Recursive Descent Parser that validates the token sequence against a defined grammar. As it parses, it generates intermediate code based on a stack machine model (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `add`).
3.  **Interpreter:** A simple stack-based Virtual Machine that executes the intermediate code generated by the parser to produce the final result.

The implemented language supports:

  - Variable declaration with the `let` keyword.
  - Integer arithmetic with `+` and `-`.
  - Printing results to the console with the `print` command.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

To compile and run the interpreter, you need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

1.  **Compile all Java files:**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:

    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```

2.  **Run the Main class:**
    Execute the compiled program with the following command:

    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

3.  **Expected Output:**
    The program will execute the code hardcoded in the `Main.java` file and print the final result to the console:

    ```
    62
    ```
